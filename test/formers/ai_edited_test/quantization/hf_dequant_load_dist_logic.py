"""Per-rank worker for test_ai_hf_dequant_load_dist.py.

Loads one fp8_block weight into a ``Shard(0)`` target on two cards.  Each rank
holds two of the four logical rows, which is block-aligned, so the transform
plans a ``"local"`` read: the physical qweight/scale slices this rank reads
cover its rows only, and the dequantized output is written without slicing.
